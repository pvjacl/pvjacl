President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed [Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942](https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/executive-order-9066). This order allowed the military to create exclusion 
zones to remove all people it chose, thus all Japanese and Japanese Americans were forced from the West Coast and other designated 
areas along the West Coast.

Between April and September 1942, the Washington
State Fairgrounds (at the time called the Puyallup
Fairgrounds) served as one of seventeen makeshift
concentration camps set up by the United States Army
as a result of Executive Order 9066.
At the “Puyallup Assembly Center” (PAC), over 7,500
Japanese and Japanese Americans from Alaska, Seattle,
and rural towns of Pierce County were imprisoned
before being moved inland to one of ten permanent
concentration camps.

In total, over 125,000 people of Japanese ancestry
living along the West Coast were imprisoned. More
than two-thirds were American-born citizens. The rest
were Issei, first generation immigrants, unable by law
to become citizens. [Learn more history at Densho.org](https://densho.org/learn/introduction/). 

The Remembrance Gallery brings awareness to the
history of the “Puyallup Assembly Center” (PAC), as
the largest temporary American concentration camp in
Washington State. The Puyallup Assembly Center was nicknamed "Camp Harmony" by an editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 
a local newspaper. The photographer mentioned in his report that the 
people from the Japanese community were quiet and harmonious.  Neither the government or military were opposed to the 
concentration camp being known as a "camp". Thus, the general public was allowed to think the prisoners were camping and 
the nickname that has remained to this day.
