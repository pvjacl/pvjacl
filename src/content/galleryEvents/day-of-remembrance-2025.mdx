The Puyallup Valley JACL welcomes you to our annual Day of Remembrance event. 
The Day of Remembrance is a way to acknowledge and honor the over 125,000 people of Japanese descent who were incarcerated during World War II.

<Quote text="The Japanese American community comes together [for the Day of Remembrance] to not only reflect, but to tell our story, teach others, and lift up voices of our community. To share the charge to ensure that our country not only learns from, but never forgets its past." source="US Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D, 7th District of California)" />
